# In this article, we will learn how to create a standard converter using tkinter. Now we are going to create an introduction window that displays loading bar, welcome text, and user’s social media profile links so that when he/she shares his code with some others, they can contact the author using those resources. It looks like a bit lengthy code, but believe me, guys if you start understanding it is so easy and i divided the code into blocks which helps you to understand better.

# Steps to create an introduction window:
# First of all, “Tkinter” and “webbrowser” modules to be imported.
# Create an intro class that fires the introduction window.
# Create a Toplevel Tkinter window in order to use full features of a window.
# Place a welcome label on the top of the window.
# Create one “ttk.Progressbar” which gives us loading effect.
# Finally, create four buttons and provide your social media links using “webbrowser” module.
# And you have to download/create four images to represent your social media links.
