# Task: Below are the steps:

# Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
# Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
# Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses

print("\n\tYou've only ",
      round(math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2)),
      " chances to guess the integer!\n")


count = 0

while count < math.log(upper - lower + 1, 2):
    count += 1

        break

    elif x < guess:
