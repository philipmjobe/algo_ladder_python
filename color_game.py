import tkinter
import random

colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Pink', 'Black',
          'Yellow', 'Orange', 'White', 'Purple', 'Brown']

score = 0

timeleft = 30


def startGame(event):
    if timeleft == 30:
        countdown()

    nextColor()


def nextColor():
    global score
    global timeleft

    if timeleft > 0:
        e.focus_set()
        if e.get().lower() == colors[1].lower():
            score += 1

        e.delete(0, tkinter.END)

        random.shuffle(colors)

        label.config(fg=str(colors[1]), text=str(colors[0]))

        scoreLabel.config(text="Score: " + str(score))
